## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(shiny)
library(tidyverse)
library(readr)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
temperature <- read_csv("temperature_at_select_stations_in_tamil_nadu_2020.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename(
    station = name_of_the_station,
    month = month,
    highest_max_temp = highest_maximum_temperature_in_celsius,
    mean_max_temp = mean_maximum_temperature_in_celsius,
    lowest_min_temp = lowest_minimum_temperature_in_celsius,
    mean_min_temp = mean_minimum_temperature_in_celsius,
    humidity_morning = percentage_of_humidity_at_08_30_hours,
    humidity_evening = percentage_of_humidity_at_17_30_hours
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    humidity_morning = as.numeric(humidity_morning),
    humidity_evening = as.numeric(humidity_evening)
  )

temperature <- temperature %>%
  mutate(month_parsed = parse_date_time(month, orders = "b'Y", locale = "en"))


# 2️⃣ Read time-series rainfall by seasons
rainfall_seasonal <- read_csv("time_series_data_rainfall_by_seasons_in_tamil_nadu_2020.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename(
    year = year,
    swm_normal = normal_rainfall_in_south_west_monsoon_in_mm,
    swm_actual = actual_rainfall_in_south_west_monsoon_in_mm,
    nem_normal = normal_rainfall_in_north_east_monsoon_in_mm,
    nem_actual = actual_rainfall_in_north_east_monsoon_in_mm,
    winter_normal = normal_rainfall_in_winter_season_in_mm,

    hot_weather_normal = normal_rainfall_in_hot_weather_season_in_mm,
    hot_weather_actual = actual_rainfall_in_hot_weather_season_in_mm,
    total_normal = total_normal_rainfall_in_mm,
    total_actual = total_actual_rainfall_in_mm,
    deviation_percentage = percentage_deviation_from_normal
  )

# 3️⃣ Read district distribution by rainfall ranges
rainfall_distribution <- read_csv("distribution_of_districts_by_range_of_rainfall_2020.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename(
    range = range_of_rainfall,
    actual_districts = actual_rainfall_occurred,
    normal_districts = normal_rainfall_expected
  )

# 4️⃣ Read rainfall by districts 2020
rainfall_districts <- read_csv("rainfall_by_districts_2020.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  rename(
    district = district,
    swm_actual = actual_rainfall_in_south_west_monsoon_june_2018_to_september_2018_in_mm,
    swm_normal = normal_rainfall_in_south_west_monsoon_june_2018_to_september_2018_in_mm,
    nem_actual = actual_rainfall_in_north_east_monsoon_october_2018_to_december_2018_in_mm,
    nem_normal = normal_rainfall_in_north_east_monsoon_october_2018_to_december_2018_in_mm,
    winter_actual = actual_rainfall_in_winter_season_january_2019_to_february_2019_in_mm,
    winter_normal = normal_rainfall_in_winter_season_january_2019_to_february_2019_in_mm,
    hot_weather_actual = actual_rainfall_in_hot_weather_season_march_2019_to_may_2019_in_mm,
    hot_weather_normal = normal_rainfall_in_hot_weather_season_march_2019_to_may_2019_in_mm,
    total_actual = total_actual_rainfall_june_2018_to_may_2019_in_mm,
    total_normal = total_normal_rainfall_june_2018_to_may_2019_in_mm
  )


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
